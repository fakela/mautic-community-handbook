We appreciate your interest in contributing to Mautic! Improving existing content is an excellent way to begin contributing. We are always looking for people to help us with writing content for documentation, our marketing and communications, and our social media campaigns.

The Education Team maintains the following documentation resources:

* [User Guide][user-guide]: Describes key concepts of Mautic and provides instructions for using and contributing to Mautic.
* [Developer Guide][developer-guide]: Describes details about the Mautic API, Webhooks, themes and plugin development.
* [Knowledge Base][knowledge-base]: Provides a database of tutorials, FAQs, and how-to articles.

We suggest beginning with any section of the documentation that is unclear, out of date, or may benefit from more description or context.
If you're reading a page of documentation and thinking, "I wish this page included more information" or "This is not the manner in which things function!!", that is an excellent place to start! 

Simply click `Edit` below the page of the [User Guide][user-guide] to access the source file or simply access GitHub directly by following these instructions [here][github]
